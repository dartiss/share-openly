# Share Openly

<img src="https://ps.w.org/social-post-embed/assets/icon.svg" style="padding: 0 20px 20px 0;" width=128px align="left">You know all those “share to Facebook” / “share to Twitter” links you see all over peoples’ websites? They’re all out of date.

Social media has evolved over the last year, yet nobody has “share to” links for Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc. There have been a few attempts to create “share to Mastodon” buttons, but they haven’t taken the larger breadth of the new social media landscape into account.

This is where Share Openly comes in.

Activate this plugin and, at the bottom of every post and/or page on your site, you’ll see a “share to social media” button. If you click it, you’ll be taken to a page that shows a number of modern, social media sites. You can select one of the pre-set sites in the list, and you’ll be taken to share a post there. But if you, for example, have a Mastodon instance, or a Known site, or an indieweb site at a different domain, you can enter that domain in the box, and Share Openly will try and find a way to let you share the page with that site.
